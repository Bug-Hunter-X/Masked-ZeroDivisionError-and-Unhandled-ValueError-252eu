# Masked ZeroDivisionError and Unhandled ValueError
This code demonstrates an uncommon scenario where a `ZeroDivisionError` is masked by a `ValueError`, and also showcases an unhandled `ValueError`. The `function_with_uncommon_error` function first checks for a zero value in `x`, and if true, attempts to perform a division by zero, causing a `ZeroDivisionError`.  However, it also includes a check to see if `y` is negative. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised. The provided test code only catches the `ValueError`, which means the `ZeroDivisionError` is masked and not reported. The solution addresses this by adding an additional try...except block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` specifically.
